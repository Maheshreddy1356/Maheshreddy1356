# ABSTRACT --->

The Smart Farming System employs a combination of sensors and IOT technology to create an automated monitoring and control system for agricultural  purposes.

The utilization of sensors like ultrasonic,soil moisture,DHT 11 and LDR interfaced with a micro controller enables real time data collection on plant growth,soil moisture content,temperature and light intensity.

The system's integration with IOT facilitates remote access to monitor  and manage these parameters.

This system presents a  solution to enhance crop yield by enabling efficient and timely interventions based on accurate environment data.
