# ABSTRACT --->

The Smart Farming System employs a combination of sensors and IOT technology to create an automated monitoring and control system for agricultural  purposes.

The utilization of sensors like ultrasonic,soil moisture,DHT 11 and LDR interfaced with a micro controller enables real time data collection on plant growth,soil moisture content,temperature and light intensity.

The system's integration with IOT facilitates remote access to monitor  and manage these parameters.

This system presents a  solution to enhance crop yield by enabling efficient and timely interventions based on accurate environment data.

# PROPOSED SYSTEM --->

The Proposed Smart Farming System integrates various cutting-edge technologies,including soil moisturesensors,ultrasonic sensos,DHT11 sensor,LDR,micro controller and IOT.

This system aims to automate and optimize crop growth conditions by continously monitoring crucial parameters such as soil moisture levels,plant growth,ambient light and temperature.

The sensors collect real-time data ,which is processed by the micro controller,enabling timely  and precise decision making.

The incorporation of IOT facilitates remote monitoring and control,allowing farmers to access and manage the farm conditions from anywhere.

Alerts through a buzzer system promptly notify farmers in case of unfavourable conditions,enabling swift interventions and optimizing crop yield.
